# Simple JSON Villager Trades
As simple as it sounds, a small jij-able library to modify/add/remove Villager trades via datapacks.

## Modifying Villager Trades
For more information on modifying villager trades, see [the wiki](wiki/Trade-Offer-JSON-Files).

## Compatibility
SJVT uses Minecraft's hardcoded trade map as a base for the datapacks to build on top of, so it should work with most mods, even those who add new villager professions.
